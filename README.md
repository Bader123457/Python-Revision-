## 📌 About the Project
Learning Python can feel overwhelming when you jump between scattered resources.  
This repository brings together concise explanations, working examples, and exercises — all written in plain English with lots of comments.

Each file focuses on a **core Python topic** so you can learn step by step, at your own pace.
